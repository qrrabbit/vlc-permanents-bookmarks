VLC Extension Loading Fix Instructions:

Method 1: VLC Preferences
1. Open VLC
2. Go to VLC > Preferences (Cmd+,)
3. Click "Show All" at bottom left
4. Navigate to Interface > Control interfaces
5. Look for Lua-related settings
6. Ensure "Lua interface" or similar is enabled

Method 2: Command Line Fix
Try launching VLC with extension debugging:
/Applications/VLC.app/Contents/MacOS/VLC --intf dummy --extraintf luaintf:dummy --verbose 2

Method 3: Check VLC Version Compatibility
VLC 3.0.18 might have extension compatibility issues.
Consider updating to latest VLC version.

Method 4: Manual Extension Loading
VLC might need explicit extension activation.
Try: VLC > Preferences > Show All > Interface > Main interfaces
Look for Lua or Extension settings.

Method 5: Reset VLC
If all else fails, completely reset VLC preferences:
1. Quit VLC
2. Delete: ~/Library/Preferences/org.videolan.vlc.plist
3. Delete: ~/Library/Application Support/org.videolan.vlc/
4. Restart VLC
5. Reinstall extensions

The core issue: VLC is not scanning/loading the extensions directory on startup.
